"""Parse an AI-written summary into cited lines and verify the citations.

A summary is only worth showing a clinician if every claim can be traced to a
real message in that patient's thread. So the rules here are strict and all-or-
nothing: the model must write one claim per line, each ending in the id(s) of the
message(s) it came from in square brackets. Anything else -- a line with no
citation, empty brackets, a citation that isn't a message id, a bracket in the
middle of the text, or an id that isn't a message in *this* patient's thread --
raises CitationError. Nothing is repaired and no citation is silently dropped;
the caller discards the whole summary.

The existence check asks the database (clinic + patient scoped), not just "was it
in the prompt", because the service role bypasses RLS and a model can invent ids.
