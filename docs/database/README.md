# database — service brief

Read this before touching `supabase/`. It's the product context a fresh thread needs;
`supabase/README.md` has the CLI commands (link, push, new migration).

## What's actually provisioned right now

A real Supabase project exists, region `ca-central-1` (Canada Central) — that's a
hard requirement, not a default; data residency matters for PHIPA. It's running on
the free plan for now: 2 active projects per account, shared with AnchorRegistry, so
AnchorRegistry's dev/testnet project is currently paused to make room for this one.
Nothing here should assume Pro-tier features (real backups, longer log retention)
exist yet — see the "Open items" section below.

Migration `00000000000001_init_schema.sql` is applied (or ready to apply via
`npx supabase db push`): `clinics`, `clinic_members`, `patients`, `procedures`,
`check_ins`, `messages`, `audit_log`. All clinic-scoped tables have row-level
security enabled, enforced through `clinic_members` — see below.

## The tenant isolation model

Tenant = clinic. Every clinical table carries `clinic_id`, and RLS policies (via the
`is_clinic_member()` helper function) scope every read to clinics the authenticated
user belongs to. This is enforced by Postgres, not application code — a bug in
`apps/api` can't leak one clinic's patients into another clinic's query results,
because the database refuses the query. When adding a new table that holds
clinic-scoped data, it gets a `clinic_id` column and an RLS policy from the same
migration that creates it — this isn't an optional follow-up step.

**Patients are not Supabase Auth users.** No patient password. Patient-facing writes
(check-ins, patient-side messages) go through `apps/api` using the service role key,
which bypasses RLS by design — `apps/api` is what validates the patient's signed link
token before writing, not the database. RLS in this schema protects the
clinician/delegate-facing paths (the web app talking to Supabase directly for auth,
and any direct client reads that go through Supabase rather than the api).

Migration `00000000000003_audit_log_chain.sql` adds `row_hash`, `signature`, `key_id` to
`audit_log`, a unique index that prevents chain forks, and `append_audit_event()` (per-clinic
advisory lock; service role only). The api computes hashes/signatures; the DB serialises appends.

Migration `00000000000004_check_in_review.sql` adds `check_ins.reviewed_at` / `reviewed_by`
(clinician review state that drives the queue) and partial indexes for the queue's reads.

Migration `00000000000005_consents.sql` adds `consents` (D12): one row per grant
(`clinic_id`, `patient_id`, `consent_type`, `consent_text_version`, `granted_at`, nullable
`revoked_at`), RLS read for clinic members via `is_clinic_member()`, and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
revoked from `authenticated`/`anon` -- only `apps/api` writes it, and audits every change.
A partial unique index allows one live grant per patient/type/wording version. It is
intentionally generic: `consent_type` is a slug check, not an enum, because the list of
consents, their wording and what they gate are still undecided (see Open items). Like all
migrations it takes effect on the shared Supabase project only after `npx supabase db push`.

Migration `00000000000006_message_drafts.sql` adds `message_drafts` (D8): a model-written reply
to one patient message, with `draft_text`, `model_id`, `prompt_version`, `status`
(pending/approved/edited/rejected), `final_text` / `sent_message_id` (set only when sent) and
who decided when. RLS read for clinic members; INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE revoked from
`authenticated`/`anon`. A CHECK ties each status to its fields (e.g. approved => final_text equals
the draft and a message was sent), a partial unique index allows one pending draft per patient
message, and `decide_message_draft()` (service role only) locks the draft, requires it still be
pending, sends the message and records the outcome in one transaction. Drafts are permanent: a
trigger blocks deletes and any change to the original columns or to a decided draft, and the
foreign keys deliberately have no ON DELETE CASCADE (deleting a clinic/patient/message a draft
points at is refused). Relaxing that needs a deliberate migration once retention is decided.
Like every migration it takes effect on the shared Supabase project only once applied (psql or `supabase db push`).

`audit_log` is append-only at the database level: `UPDATE`/`DELETE` are revoked for
`authenticated`/`anon` entirely, not just gated by a policy. Only the service role
(i.e. only `apps/api`) can write to it. Note the service role itself still *can*
update/delete (only `authenticated`/`anon` are revoked) -- tampering by a service-role
holder is detectable via the signed chain, not prevented by grants.

## Mapping to the data catalogue

`claude/data-catalogue.md` is the authoritative list of every data class the product
touches, with sensitivity, residency, and retention notes. The current schema covers
a subset of it:

| Catalogue ID | What | Table |
|---|---|---|
| D4 | Patient identity/contact | `patients` |
| D5 | Clinician/delegate accounts | `clinic_members` (roles: owner/clinician/delegate) |
| D6/D7 | Messages (patient/clinician) | `messages` |
| D29 | Structured check-in answers | `check_ins` |
| D12 | Consent records | `consents` (generic; wording/types/gating undecided) |
| D8 | AI message drafts | `message_drafts` |
| D11 | Touchpoint events (calls, visits, emails, messages) | `touchpoints` |
| D16/D17 | Audit log, signed and hash-chained | `audit_log` |

Not yet modeled, and not needed until their stage comes up: D9
(wound photos — v2, blocked in v1), D10 (confirmed summary facts, sourced from her
own Accuro notes, later stage), D13 (protocol/template library), D14 (derived
scores/triage priority), D22 (model/prompt version metadata, hashed into attestation
events). Add these as their features get built, each with its own migration — don't
pre-build the whole catalogue speculatively.

## Open items (genuinely unresolved, don't guess)

- **Consent specifics** (Sarah's call). The wording, which `consent_type`s exist (messaging vs.
  AI-assisted communication per the catalogue), and whether a missing consent blocks check-in
  or messaging are all undecided; `consents` stores and audits whatever the api is told and
  gates nothing. Whether a withdrawal can be recorded by a clinician on a patient's behalf is
  open too.
- **Known audit gap.** A business row and its `audit_log` row are separate writes, so a failed
  audit write leaves an unaudited row. Detected, not prevented: `python -m
  clinically_anchored_api.core.reconcile` (in `apps/api`) lists such rows by cross-referencing
  `audit_log.metadata` (`ref_type`/`ref_id`) with the business tables. Making the two writes
  atomic (one SQL function) is the eventual fix if this matters in practice.

- **Plan tier for compliance features.** Free plan has no backups and 1-day log
  retention. Pro ($25/mo) gets 7-day backups and 7-day logs but still no
  HIPAA-equivalent add-on (that's Team, $599/mo). Fine for synthetic data; revisit
  before any real patient touches this.
- **Inference location** (local vs. Canadian-region zero-retention vs. minimal-fact
  cloud) is unresolved — don't assume where embeddings/LLM calls happen when
  designing tables that might feed them.
- **OHIP number** — data-catalogue.md leans toward not storing it at all. Don't add
  the column without checking whether that's been settled.
- **Retention period and system-of-record question** — is this app the system of
  record, or a channel on top of Accuro (likely)? Affects what "delete" should mean
  here, so don't build hard-delete flows without this being settled.
